I am considering this a personal project. By the way, my first time building a PC (actually a Mini-PC). Before this, I always used OEM laptop and this project was all about how I can make the most epic PC for less money while reusing existing components from old laptops. In my case, i used RAM, HDD from my previous laptop, and Google Home-Mini which for lying around for speakers.

The whole concept is, $ave that Money :wink:
