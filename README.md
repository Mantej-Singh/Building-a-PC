# Team RED!

![startimage](git-images/intro.png)

The most useful side of current Pendamic is, I had a lot of time to work on something I always wanted to do. From my high school time, I have watched a lot of video tutorials where YouTubers make high-end Gaming PCs and Workstations. So I am considering this as my pet project. By the way, this is my first time building a PC (actually a Mini-PC). Before this, I have always used an OEM laptop (HP and DELL), and this project was all about how I can make the most epic PC for less money while reusing existing components from previous and old laptops. In this project, I used RAM, HDD from my other laptop, and used Google Home-Mini as a Bluetooth speaker:wink:

*Note: The Bluetooth connection for the Google Home devices are for input only. You cannot use it for conference calls*

# Motivation:
You may think, why now? Why AMD?
There are many reasons, few of them are
 
- Working from home: more tabs + more programs, I needed a better processor than my 2 Core i7-6600U from Q3'15.
- Needed something with Graphics to edit videos 
- But the major component of motivation was **Henry Cavill**:muscle:. I am a huge fan of him, and after watching his PC building <a href="https://jamonline.ph/tech-news/watch-henry-cavill-seductively-build-a-300k-gaming-pc//"> video</a>, I then and there decided even I want to build a PC NOW!! ....and the search for the parts began

# Making a List:

I needed a CPU, a CPU Cooler, a Motherboard which can use a **SODIMM** memory, NVme SSD (not the SATA SSD), Graphic Card, and a case. I already had two Monitors (Thanks to my friend for giving me his monitor), 1x8GB RAM, 1x500GB HDD, speakers, and 14TB Seagate External hard drive. So I started looking for a case and to my surprise, there are a lot! From NZXT, Corsair, Cooler Master. So to make it simple, I started looking for**Mini-PC builds**:eyes:

*Info: You can use <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/"> PPpartpicker </a> for customer builds, they provide part selection, compatibility, and pricing guidance for do-it-yourself computer builders*

# Finding the One:

There are a handful of Mini-PC options, but I was mainly looking for a **Barebones** system (no CPU, SSD, RAM), also known as a Small form-factor (SFF). Top names are Intel NUC, Lenovo ThinkCentre, HP Mini Workstations, but as I said earlier, I ditched Intel and wanted a cheap yet powerful system. But where could I find it? ü§î

*Drum roll*ü•Å 

### AMD APUs!

# Ryzen Shine:

Once I made my mind for AMD, I shortlisted listed two of the manufacturers which I liked.

 - <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-next-gen-minis-amd-yes#/"> Minisforum - DMAF5 </a>
 - <a href="https://asrock.com/nettop/AMD/DeskMini%20A300%20Series/"> ASRock DeskMini A300W </a>

#### Minisforum - DMAF5 Story:
I found about them from my Google Feeds (thanks Google lady:+1:). I watched a few videos, researched for hours on the company's background, and whether I should buy it or not. I found out that they are a promising company, and their product is solid. I joined their FB group asked a few questions which I had, they are kind, supportive, and fast in replying to people‚Äôs queries.

But the only thing that made me not choose Minisforum was- **TIME**:sparkles:, so the thing is that they have launched a funding campaign on Indiegogo and it will take them 2-3 months (October ending) to ships the final product to the users worldwide. And I wanted my PC in a few weeks, I did not have that much patience so I moved forward with **ASRock**, also they don't have an option for barebones

# The Magnificient AMD APU:

AMD's APUs blend CPU with Radeon Vega graphics on a single ready-to-game chip. Fortunately, ASRock DeskMini supports Ryzen 3000 series right out of the box. And I had two options for APUs:
<img src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/AMD-Vega-11.jpg"></a>


- The Ryzen 3 3200G- 3.6/4.0 GHz, (4C/4T), Vega 8 Graphics, Unlocked, $100
- The Ryzen 5 3400G- 3.7/4.2 GHz, (4C/8T), Vega 11 Graphics, Unlocked, $150

![vs](git-images/3v5.jpg)

AMD APUs come with cooler, I wanted Wraith Spire but the issue was its big size could not fit inside DeskMini case. So I saved 50 bucks and went for 3200G AMD Wraith Stealth :sunglasses:

# ASRock DeskMini A300W:
<a href="https://asrock.com/nettop/AMD/DeskMini%20A300%20Series/#Overview"> ![vs](git-images/DeskMini.png)</a>


You can read an in-depth  review of it from <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/14251/asrock-deskmini-a300-review-an-affordable-diy-amd-ryzen-minipc"> Anandtech </a> and specs can be found <a href="https://asrock.com/nettop/AMD/DeskMini%20A300%20Series/#Specification"> here.</a>

I finally found what I ever wanted, a barebone system where I can use my exiting SODIMM DDR4 RAM and I have few HDD lying around which I can use them on the board as a RAID setup.
