I am considering this a personal project. By the way, my first time building a PC (actually a Mini-PC). Before this, I always used OEM laptop and this project was all about how I can make the most epic PC for less money while reusing existing components from old laptops. In my case, i used RAM, HDD from my previous laptop, and Google Home-Mini which for lying around for speakers.

The whole concept is, $ave that Money :wink:

- Needed something with Graphics to edit videos 
- But the major component of motivation was **Henry Cavil**. I am a huge fan of him, and after watching his PC building <a href="https://jamonline.ph/tech-news/watch-henry-cavill-seductively-build-a-300k-gaming-pc//"> video</a>, I then and there decided even I want to build a PC NOW!! ....and the search for the parts began
