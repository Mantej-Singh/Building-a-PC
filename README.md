I am considering this a personal project. By the way, my first time building a PC (actually a Mini-PC). Before this, I always used OEM laptop and this project was all about how I can make the most epic PC for less money while reusing existing components from old laptops. In my case, i used RAM, HDD from my previous laptop, and Google Home-Mini which for lying around for speakers.

The whole concept is, $ave that Money :wink:

# Motivation:
You may think, why now? Why AMD?
There are many reasons, few of them are
 
- Working from home: more tabs + more programs, I needed a better processor than my 2 Core i7-6600U from Q3'15.
- Needed something with Graphics to edit videos 
- But the main reason was Henry Cavil
